/**
 * Renderer-bundle skew detection.
 *
 * The desktop UI (including bundled plugins like Bot Mode) is compiled into
 * the app binary at build time, while `hermes update` only moves the source
 * tree. A user who updates from the terminal — or whose in-app update failed
 * on the bundle-swap leg — ends up running a NEW runtime under an OLD
 * renderer: About proudly reports the new Hermes version while the sidebar
 * is missing the features that version shipped (the "no Bots tab after the
 * Bot Mode update" reports).
 *
 * Detection: the packaged build carries install-stamp.json with the commit
 * it was built from. If commits touching the RUNTIME paths of apps/desktop
 * exist in the source tree AFTER that stamp commit, the running renderer is
 * provably missing desktop changes the installed runtime has:
 *
 *   git merge-base --is-ancestor <stampCommit> HEAD
 *   git rev-list --count <stampCommit>..HEAD -- <RUNTIME_PATHS>
 *
 * Ancestry has to come first, because `A..HEAD` only means "how far HEAD is
 * ahead of A" when A is an ancestor of HEAD. When it is not, the range
 * degenerates to HEAD's own history and the count stops describing skew at
 * all: an update that rewrote the tree into a synthetic root leaves a stamp
 * commit that still resolves but sits on a disconnected graph, so the count
 * is a permanent >= 1 even when apps/desktop is byte-identical (#92233).
 * Resolving the stamp is not enough — an unknown commit already exits
 * non-zero below, but a merely *unrelated* one exits 0 with a positive count.
 *
 * Scoping to runtime paths keeps this quiet for the common cases where the
 * repo advances without user-visible desktop changes: agent-only commits
 * elsewhere in the repo, and docs / e2e spec / dev-script churn under
 * apps/desktop that never reaches the shipped renderer or main process
 * (#99832).
 *
 * Fail-quiet by design: no stamp (dev runs), a fallback all-zero stamp
 * (non-git build), an unknown commit (stamp predates a shallow clone's
 * history), a stamp that is not an ancestor of HEAD, or any git failure all
 * report "not stale". This warning must never false-positive — it tells
 * users their install is torn.
 *
 * Pure + injectable so it is testable without booting Electron or git.
